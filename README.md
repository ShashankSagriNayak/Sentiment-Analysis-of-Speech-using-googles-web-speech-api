# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Speech-using-googles-web-speech-api
Designed a speech sentiment analysis tool that converts real-time audio to text using Googleâ€™s Web Speech API. Analyzed transcribed text with VADER Sentiment Analyzer, incorporating idiom detection to refine sentiment scoring. The system reports positive, negative, neutral, and compound sentiment scores. Developed a user-friendly GUI using CustomTkinter for speech input and result visualization. Utilized Python libraries including sounddevice, speech_recognition, and matplotlib. Demonstrated strong performance across varied speech samples, with potential for future emotional nuance enhancements.
